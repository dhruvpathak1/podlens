# PodLens

PodLens is an AI-powered context generator for podcasts. It listens to audio, transcribes it, and automatically enriches the content by identifying key references such as people, companies, locations, and technologies—and adding relevant images, maps, and summaries in real-time.

## Features

- **Audio Transcription:** Powered by OpenAI's Whisper for accurate, timestamped transcripts.
- **Entity Extraction:** Automatically identifies entities like People, Companies, Locations, and Events using either spaCy or Anthropic's Claude.
- **Context Enrichment:**
  - **Wikipedia:** Pulls summaries and thumbnails for identified entities.
  - **OpenStreetMap (Nominatim):** Generates interactive map previews for mentioned locations.
  - **Unsplash:** Finds high-quality, relevant stock photos to visualize the discussion.
- **Interactive UI:** A modern React interface to view transcripts alongside their enriched context "cards".

cd ..
```

## Configuration

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
3. Open `.env` and fill in your API keys:
   - `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY`: Get one from [Unsplash Developers](https://unsplash.com/developers).
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: (Optional) If you want to use Claude for entity extraction.
   - `NOMINATIM_USER_AGENT`: Set this to your app name or email

## Running the App

You can run both the frontend and the backend simultaneously from the root directory:

```bash
npm run dev
```

- **Frontend:** [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
- **Backend API:** [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)

The first time you run a transcription, the Whisper model (default: `base`) will be downloaded automatically. This may take a few minutes depending on your internet connection.
